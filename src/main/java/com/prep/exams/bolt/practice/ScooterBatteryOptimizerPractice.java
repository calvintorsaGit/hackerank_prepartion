/**
 * Bolt Exam: Scooter Battery Optimizer
 *
 * Given N scooters with battery levels (0-100%) and M trip distances (km),
 * assign trips to scooters to maximize the number of completed trips.
 *
 * Rules:
 * - Battery drains 5% per km (e.g. 50% battery = 10 km range)
 * - A scooter can only take a trip if it has enough battery
 * - One scooter can serve multiple trips (battery keeps draining)
 *
 * Return the maximum number of trips that can be completed.
 *
 * Example:
 * batteryLevels = [50, 80, 30], tripDistances = [5, 3, 8, 2]
 * Output: 4 (all trips can be assigned)
