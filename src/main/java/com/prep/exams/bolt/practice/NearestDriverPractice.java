/**
 * Bolt Exam: Nearest Driver
 *
 * Given a passenger location [x, y] and a list of driver locations
 * [[x1,y1], [x2,y2], ...], find the K nearest drivers.
 *
 * Return: indices of k nearest drivers, sorted ascending.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - 1 <= k <= drivers.length <= 10^5
 * - Coordinates can be negative
 *
 * Example:
 * passenger = [0, 0]
 * drivers = [[3,3], [1,1], [5,5], [2,2]]
 * k = 2
 * Output: [1, 3] (drivers at [1,1] and [2,2])
